## 1. Principles of Security

### Confidentiality
Data is only accessible to those with permission.

### Integrity
Data must not be altered without authorization.

### Availability
Systems and data must remain usable and online.

These three form the CIA Triad.

---

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication
Verifying identity.  
Examples:
- Password login
- MFA (OTP, authenticator apps)
- Device-based trust

### Authorization
What the user is allowed to access after login.

Example:
- Staff can access StaffShare
- Students cannot access StaffShare

## 3. Least Privilege

Users should have the **minimum** access needed to do their job.  
Benefits:
- Limits damage from mistakes  
- Reduces risk from compromised accounts  

---

## 4. Password & Credential Hygiene

Best practices:
- Minimum 8–12 chars  
- Mix of letters, numbers, symbols  
- Avoid reuse  
- Avoid storing passwords in plain text  
- Enable MFA whenever possible  

Common bad behaviors:
- Password “123456”
- Password shared antar orang kantor
- Sticky notes on monitor

---

## 5. Patching & Updates

Why updating matters:
- Fixes vulnerabilities  
- Improves device stability  
- Blocks known exploits  

IT Support role:
- Ensure Windows Update runs properly  
- Check app versions  
- Patch browsers, drivers, and antivirus  

---

## 6. Device Hardening Basics

Examples:
- Disable unnecessary services  
- Block autorun USB  
- Remove unused apps  
- Restrict local admin accounts  
- Set strong lock screen timers  

---

## 7. Network Safety

Basic checks:
- Secure WiFi with WPA2/WPA3  
- Router admin panel must have strong password  
- Disable WPS  
- Segment guest network  

---

## 8. Social Engineering Awareness

Common attacks:
- Phishing email  
- Fake “admin support” calls  
- Malicious links  
- Fake software installers  

Prevention:
- Verify sender identity  
- Don’t click random links  
- Enable email spam filters  
- Train users to report suspicious messages  

---

## 9. Malware Basics

Types:
- Virus  
- Worm  
- Trojan  
- Keylogger  
- Ransomware  

Mitigation:
- Keep OS updated  
- Use reputable antivirus  
- Don’t download random apps  
- Back up important files  

---

## 10. Logging & Monitoring

Important logs:

Windows Event Viewer
Application logs
Security logs
System logs

Logs help track:
- failed login attempts  
- suspicious behaviors  
- software crashes  
- service failures
